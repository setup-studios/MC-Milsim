## About

MC-Milsim is a work-in-progress Minecraft mod focused on delivering a highly tactical and realistic military simulation experience. Based on the success of games like *Squad*, MC-Milsim brings the thrill of modern warfare to the blocky world of Minecraft. This mod aims to allow players to experience intense team-based combat, strategic gameplay, and realistic mechanics.

The project is currently in its early stages, with many features still in development. Our goal is to make a fully functional Milsim mod that incorporates vehicle combat, weaponry, strategic roles, and teamwork, all within the sandbox environment of Minecraft.

## Features

* **Team-Based Gameplay**: Engage in large-scale team fights with roles, communication, and coordination similar to military simulations.
* **Realistic Combat Mechanics**: Enjoy improved weapon handling, ballistics, and vehicle interactions designed to mimic real-world military scenarios.
* **Role System**: Play as different military roles, such as rifleman, medic, engineer, and more, with specific tasks that contribute to team success.
* **Voice Communication Integration**: Like in *Squad*, communication between teammates will be key to victory, with in-game voice chat integration.
* **Vehicles and Equipment**: Ride in and operate military vehicles, using a variety of weapons and gear.
* **Immersive Environments**: Experience carefully designed environments for tactical gameplay, inspired by real-world maps and military layouts.
